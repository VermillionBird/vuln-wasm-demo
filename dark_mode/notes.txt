Buffer Overflow -> XSS

tried multiple approaches of injection
1 ended up injecting into popup instead
needed to change csp to allow unsafe-wasm-eval
tried both v2 and v3

Lots of issues trying to get extension to load wasm
turns out needed to modify created js glue

issues with converting between strings

var f = chrome.runtime.getURL('dark_mode.wasm');
emcc -o dark_mode.js dark_mode.c -s WASM=1 -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_main', '_generate_content', 'lengthBytesUTF8', 'stringToUTF8', '_free', '_malloc']" -s "EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=['ccall', 'cwrap']"
